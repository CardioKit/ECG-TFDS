### Custom ECG Dataset

If you have a custom ECG that you want to process in the same format as the in-place records, you can follow the steps below:

1. add your ECG data in csv format to the `./data/` folder.
2. make sure that the desired channel is in the first column.
3. adjust the TODOs in the file ```custom_dataset_builder.py```.
4. continue as in the main README
