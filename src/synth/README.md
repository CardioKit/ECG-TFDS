# ECGSYN - A realistic ECG waveform generator

ECGSYN is a collection of software packages for generating realistic ECG waveforms.
A number of settable parameters are available, including mean heart rate, number of beats, sampling frequency, waveform morphology, standard deviation of the RR interval, and LF/HF ratio (a measure of the relative contributions of the low and high frequency components of the RR time series to total heart rate variability).
